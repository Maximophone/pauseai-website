It's happening. Our second international protest.
The goal: convince the few powerful individuals (ministers) who will be visiting the next AI Safety [Summit](/summit) (the 22nd of May) to be the adults in the room.
It's up to us to make them understand that this shit is real, that they are the only ones who have the power to fix the problem.
